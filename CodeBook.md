The following information relates to the information contained in the dataset generated by running the included
R script - run_analysis.R.

Subject_ID - the identifier of the subject taking part in the experiment. The subjects were taken from a group
of 30 volunteers between the ages of 19 and 48.
Activity - the description of the activity the subject performed. The following six activities were included:
 1. Laying
 2. Sitting
 3. Standing
 4. Walking
 5. Walking Downstairs
 6. Walking Upstairs

The following features are included in the dataset:
